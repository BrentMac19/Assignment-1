                The WWP was founded in 2003 by John Melia. Melia is a wounded veteran himself. WWP started out by giving backpacks filled with comfort items to veterans at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. From 2003 to 2005 it was a division of the United Spinal Association of New York. In September of 2005, the United Spinal Association granted $2.7 million to WWP to develop into its own charity.<br>

                This grant allowed the WWP to develop into a long-term supporter of veterans. The project began helping veterans with compensation, education health care, housing, employment, insurance, and more. The organization continues to distribute backpacks. They've given more than 65,000 backpacks as of early 2018 to veterans.
