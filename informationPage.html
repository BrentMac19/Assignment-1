        <h2>Family Support Programs</h2>
        <p>Nearly 800,000 School-aged children have a parent serving in the Military,
            This brings an uproar into the family because children dont quite understand
            why the parent has to leave. Also the transition from Service member to civilian
            can be difficult for a Veteren. Through Veteren Support Programs provided by the WWP
            this transition becomes much easier because they help families of veterans reconnect 
            through events that support family bonding an transitional skills, by providing space 
            and time for veterens to spend with their love ones.

        <h2>Warriors To Work</h2>
        <p>Approimently 53% of homeless Veterans have disailities. That is more than half!
            This is due to lack of support, of transition to a work enviornment. WWP provides 
            a program called Warrior To Work, This program connects veterans with employers and
            resources for jobs. They also provide Career counseling, so veterans can find work That
            best fits their skill sets and allows them to smoothly transition into civilian life.

        <h2>Mental Wellness</h2>
        <p>11-12% of service members are suffering from PTSD, This is a very difficult disablility to live
            with and can be very hard for a Veteran to over come without proper care. Veteran mental
            health programs are an important staple in a veterans journey to mental Wellness. WWP provides
            interactive programs, rehabilitation retreats, and free mental health counseling.
